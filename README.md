## ChatADS

ChatADS is a GPT that allows users to search NASA ADS and ask questions about paper content using natural language.

It uses the NASA ADS API along with an API for arXiv paper Q&A developed by Tom Tumiel.

If you have ChatGPT Plus you can talk to ChatADS and receive summaries of the papers, figures in those papers, tables that synthesize the results from multiple papers, and to ask questions like: “What is Jo Bovy’s group up to nowadays?” All in natural language.
